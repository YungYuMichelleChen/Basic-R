## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#The matrix fills up value by column, 
x<- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
x
y<- matrix(1:12, 4, 3, byrow= TRUE)

z <- matrix(1:12, 3, 4, byrow=TRUE)
z

#To perform a proper matrix multiplication
#t stands for transpose
x %*% t(y)

#submatrices
x[3,]

#The c(1, 3) only extract the 1st & 3rd columns
x[1:3,c(1,3)]

#Labelling the rows and columns of the matrix 
colnames(x) = c("Col1", "Col2", "Col3")

```

--------------------Some Matrix functions---------------------
```{r}
v = matrix(c(5, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4), 3, 3, byrow=TRUE)
v

det(v) #to show the determinants

inv.v = solve(v) #inverse

eigen(v) #to show eigenvalues and eigenvectors

```

--------------------Some Matrix functions---------------------
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
x<-seq(1:50)
y<- 3+0.1*x+rnorm(50)
regmod <- lm(y~x)
names(regmod)

#either to use $sign or position [[]]
regmod$coefficients
regmod[[1]]

```
```{r DataFrame}
library(MASS)
painters

#to access particular variables with $
painters$Expression

#if the data 'painters' is long-winded, can reduce the typing by attaching the data frame 
#When you have finished with a particular data frame -> detach

attach(painters)
Expression
detach(painters)

#Caveat:  attach could be harmful
lm(painters$Composition ~ painters$Drawing)
lm(Composition~Drawing, data = painters)

##Otherwise, to use the function with() to specify the name of the datframe

with(painters, plot(Composition, Drawing))
plot(painters$Composition, painters$Drawing)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
